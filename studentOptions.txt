There are 3 general options for immigration as a student: student visas, working holiday visas, and Spain’s Auxillary. 

Student Visas

Most countries have some form of a student visa. In general, you must be accepted to a university or language program and show you have income to support yourself. If your native country offers student loans (like the US) you may be able to access those abroad. 

Some countries even offer free education, so you’d only have to pay for a few university fees, typically amounting to a few hundred dollars.

Typically, you’re allowed to work up to 20 hours per week during the school year and 40 hours per week during breaks. Most countries will offer you a work permit for 1 – 2 years after you complete your studies.

Germany several graduate programs taught in English. Most undergraduate programs are taught in German. They offer a list of all programs.

Working Holiday Visa

If you’re between 18 and 35 (or within one year of having graduated from school, or currently in school) there’s a good chance you can take advantage of a working holiday visa. Some visas are limited to those between 18 and 30, so check them all if you’re interested.

Working holiday visas are usually for one year and not renewable, so it’s not a pathway to citizenship. You’re typically allowed to work for 40 hours per week.

Spain Auxiliares de Conversación (language assistant)
https://www.educacionyfp.gob.es/eeuu/convocatorias-programas/convocatorias-eeuu/nalcap.html

Spain’s Auxiliares de Conversación is open to American passport holders between 18 and 60 who have graduated from a bachelors or associates degree or are in their last year of education. 

You’re paid a salary and work 12 – 16 hours per week in a Spanish school as an English language assistant. You’ll also teach students about American culture.

This is considered a student visa, so it does count towards time for citizenship or permanent residency but I’ve heard that there’s such a demand for this program that they only let you do it for 3 years.
